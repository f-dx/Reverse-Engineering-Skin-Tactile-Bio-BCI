# Reverse-Engineering-Skin-Tactile-Bio-BCI

Tactile interface for the illegal covert BCI:

1. Often misdiagnosed as Benign fasciculation syndrome
2. Causing muscle twitches with fall-back mechanism. If location is unavailable, sends signals to near location.
3. Dermis skin layer is invaded by genetically modified organisms or synthetic organisms (requires verification)
4. Uses calcium channels activation to generate micro-contractions (verified, requires lab confirmation)
5. Covers 60-70% of body skin (requires verification)
6. Located non-uniformly, follows the structure of neural system with pathways (requires verification)
7. Sensitive to salts: NaCl and Mg - block locally the BCI bio agents with 75% efficiency for 5-12 hours (verified, tested)
8. Sensitive to skin damage: local skin damage blocks signal transfer and blocks micro-contraction in specific body location
9. Parts of illegal skin BCI are visible in ultra-violet spectrum, can be detected using spectrum analizer (probably graphene oxide, requires verification)
10. Ears drums and mucous membranes are also covered by BCI components - which could induce V2K experience and irritation of eyes and nose (probably graphene oxide, requires verification)
11. Maximum micro-contractions intensity is equal to 1.5V-2.5V produced by TENS devices
12. Could cause severe itch, which can be also controlled remotely - localization on skin from 2mm to 3cm diameter
13. Could cause local intense pain - the mechanism of action is unknown, requires research
14. Uses LTE RF bands for communication with cell towers. Likely transducers are used.
15. Has offline mode, can operate without LTE connection.
16. Sensitive to UV light (requires verification)
17. Used as a channel of communication for Hive Mind Society
