# Reverse-Engineering-Skin-Tactile-Bio-BCI

Tactile interface for the illegal covert BCI uses the following:

1. Often misdiagnosed as Benign fasciculation syndrome
2. Dermis skin layer is invaded by genetically modified organisms or synthetic organisms (requires verification)
3. Uses calcium channels activation to generate micro-contractions (verified, requires lab confirmation)
4. Covers 60-70% of body skin (requires verification)
5. Located non-uniformly, follows the structure of neural system with pathways (requires verification)
6. Sensitive to salts: NaCl and Mg - block locally the BCI bio agents with 75% efficiency for 5-12 hours (verified, tested)
7. Sensitive to skin damage: local skin damage blocks signal transfer and blocks micro-contraction in specific body location
8. Parts of illegal skin BCI are visible in ultra-violet spectrum, can be detected using spectrum analizer (probably graphene oxide, requires verification)
9. Ears drums and mucous membranes are also covered by BCI components - which could induce V2K experience and irritation of eyes and nose (probably graphene oxide, requires verification)
10. Maximum micro-contractions intensity is equal to 1.5V-2.5V produced by TENS devices
11. Could cause severe itch, which can be also controlled remotely - localization on skin from 2mm to 3cm diameter
12. Could cause local intense pain - the mechanism of action is unknown, requires research
